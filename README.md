# EndlessRunnerGame_Java

The application is an "endless runner" type of game, written in Java and Android Studio. The game is built from scratch, using [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) and without a game engine. See a short demonstration of the game in the video below, recorded from the Android Studio emulator (hence the lag).
